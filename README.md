# Healthcare_Application

Abstract
This sections contains the summary of how our android application is working throughout the ever increasing health sector. It will give you brief over view of how it the app works in short time.
The Healthcare App is created for one sole purpose; it is to create a link between the doctors & the patients. This works for two types of registrations. One as Doctor & the other as a patient.
Doctor Registration
If one creates a profile as a doctor, then he can
• easily manage his patients through digital database system. It will be directed to him by the application management team.
• study his patients by accessing their previous health records.
Patient Registration
If anyone registers as a patient, then he can access many advantages such as
• fixing appointments
• seeing doctors
• BMI calculator
• health related books
• receiving reports through the app
• Accessing different Govt. Health websites
• 24x7 Emergency Ambulance Service through direct call.
The main work of the app in this project is to be the middle ground between the doctors & the patients as now-a-days the it is seen that there is a huge wastage to time for appointment waiting & report. Even it is seen that the doctor is absent or attending an emergency.
So this App can act as a bridge to help doctors & patients collaborate with each other.
